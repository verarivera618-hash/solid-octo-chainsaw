# üöÄ Alpaca Integration Ready!

Your backtesting system is now configured to work with Alpaca Markets! Here's how to get started:

## ‚úÖ What's Been Set Up

1. **Alpaca Data Provider** (`src/data/AlpacaDataProvider.ts`)
   - Fetches real-time and historical market data
   - Manages account information and positions
   - Handles order placement and cancellation

2. **Alpaca Trade Executor** (`src/core/AlpacaTradeExecutor.ts`)
   - Executes live trades through Alpaca API
   - Manages positions and orders
   - Checks market hours

3. **Configuration Integration**
   - Alpaca credentials are managed through environment variables
   - Automatic switching between paper and live trading
   - Fallback to Yahoo Finance if Alpaca not configured

## üîê Setting Up Your Alpaca Credentials

### Step 1: Get Your API Keys

1. **Sign up for Alpaca** (if you haven't already):
   - Go to https://app.alpaca.markets/
   - Create a free account
   - Verify your email

2. **Get Paper Trading Keys** (recommended for testing):
   - Log into your Alpaca account
   - Navigate to the "Paper Trading" section
   - Click on "View" under API Keys
   - Generate new API keys if needed
   - Copy your API Key ID and Secret Key

3. **For Live Trading** (use with extreme caution):
   - Complete account verification
   - Fund your account
   - Navigate to "Live Trading" section
   - Generate API keys

### Step 2: Configure Your Environment

Edit the `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
# Edit the .env file
nano .env
# or
vim .env
# or use any text editor
```

Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials:

```env
ALPACA_API_KEY=PKxxxxxxxxxxxxx
ALPACA_SECRET_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
ALPACA_ENVIRONMENT=paper  # Use 'paper' for testing, 'live' for real trading
```

### Step 3: Test Your Connection

Run the test script to verify everything is working:

```bash
# Using npx and tsx (recommended)
npx tsx test-alpaca-connection.ts

# Or if you prefer using node after building
npm run build
node dist/../test-alpaca-connection.js
```

## üìä What You Can Do Now

### 1. Fetch Real Market Data
```typescript
import { AlpacaDataProvider } from './src/data/AlpacaDataProvider.js';

const alpaca = new AlpacaDataProvider();
const data = await alpaca.getPriceData('AAPL', startDate, endDate);
```

### 2. Check Account Status
```typescript
const account = await alpaca.getAccountInfo();
console.log(`Buying Power: $${account.buying_power}`);
```

### 3. Execute Paper Trades
```typescript
import { AlpacaTradeExecutor } from './src/core/AlpacaTradeExecutor.js';

const executor = new AlpacaTradeExecutor(0.001, 0.0005);
// Your trading logic here
```

### 4. Monitor Positions
```typescript
const positions = await alpaca.getPositions();
positions.forEach(pos => {
  console.log(`${pos.symbol}: ${pos.qty} shares`);
});
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Safety Notes

1. **Always Start with Paper Trading**
   - Test your strategies thoroughly in paper mode
   - Verify your logic works as expected
   - Monitor for at least a week before considering live trading

2. **API Rate Limits**
   - Alpaca has rate limits: 200 requests/minute for most endpoints
   - The system handles this gracefully but be aware when running high-frequency strategies

3. **Security Best Practices**
   - Never commit `.env` file to version control
   - Keep your API keys secret
   - Use paper trading for all testing
   - Set up stop-losses and position limits

4. **Live Trading Checklist** (if you decide to go live):
   - [ ] Tested strategy for at least 2 weeks in paper mode
   - [ ] Verified positive returns in paper trading
   - [ ] Set maximum position sizes
   - [ ] Implemented stop-loss logic
   - [ ] Have monitoring and alerting set up
   - [ ] Started with small amounts
   - [ ] Understood all risks involved

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Connection Test Fails
```bash
# Check if credentials are set
cat .env | grep ALPACA

# Verify they're not placeholder values
# Should NOT see "your_api_key_here"
```

### API Errors
- **401 Unauthorized**: Check your API keys are correct
- **403 Forbidden**: Verify you're using the right environment (paper vs live)
- **429 Too Many Requests**: You've hit rate limits, slow down requests

### No Market Data
- Check if market is open: Markets are typically open Mon-Fri 9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET
- Verify the symbol exists and is tradeable
- Check your Alpaca subscription level

## üìö Next Steps

1. **Run the connection test** to verify setup:
   ```bash
   npx tsx test-alpaca-connection.ts
   ```

2. **Try fetching some market data** for your favorite stocks

3. **Run a backtest** using real Alpaca historical data

4. **Start paper trading** with a simple strategy

5. **Monitor and refine** your strategies based on paper trading results

## üéâ Success Indicators

- ‚úÖ API connection confirmed
- ‚úÖ Account information retrieved
- ‚úÖ Current positions listed (if any)
