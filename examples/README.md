```python
integration.analyze_and_generate_task(
    tickers=["AAPL"],
    strategy_name="momentum_strategy"
)
```

### 2. Semiconductor Sector Strategy
```python
integration.analyze_and_generate_task(
    tickers=["AMD", "NVDA", "INTC"],
    strategy_name="semiconductor_momentum",
    additional_context="Focus on AI and data center trends"
)
```

### 3. Risk-Managed Strategy
```python
# See advanced_usage.py for complete example
# Includes Kelly Criterion, correlation limits, and dynamic risk management
```

### 4. Sector Rotation Strategy
```python
# See advanced_usage.py for complete example
# Analyzes multiple sectors and implements rotation logic
```

### 5. Earnings Play Strategy

```

## 🔧 Configuration

Before running examples, ensure you have:

1. **API Keys configured** in `.env` file
2. **Dependencies installed** (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
3. A local editor (VS Code, Vim, etc.)

## 📈 Generated Outputs

Each example generates:
- **Comprehensive prompts** for local implementation
- **Structured market analysis** from Perplexity
- **Technical indicators** and price data
- **Risk management parameters**
- **Complete trading strategy specifications**

## 🎯 Next Steps

After running examples:

1. **Open the generated prompt** from `local_tasks/`
2. **Copy its content** into your local editor
3. **Implement** the files and logic described in `src/`
4. **Run tests** with `pytest` and iterate locally

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Paper trading only** - Examples use paper trading mode by default
- **API limits** - Be mindful of Perplexity and Alpaca API rate limits
- **Testing** - Always test strategies with paper trading first
- **Risk management** - Implement proper risk controls before live trading

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Connection Errors**
   - Check your `.env` file configuration
   - Verify API keys are correct
   - Ensure you have sufficient API credits

2. **Import Errors**
   - Make sure you're running from the project root
   - Check that all dependencies are installed
   - Verify Python path configuration

3. **Cursor Agent Issues**
   - Ensure Privacy Mode is disabled
   - Check that usage-based spending is enabled
   - Verify GitHub repository connection
